Hi, I am a mostly Python developer . I created this blog as an experiment on frontend encryption but nowdays I kind of use it as a normal blog. If you wish to receive updates you can subscribe to RSS feed. I deleted Google analytics from this site because I dont want to track you so I have literally no idea if anybody ever reads this blog. 

My professional careeer in programming includes: 

- 2 years of developing [Seeder](https://github.com/WebArchivCZ/Seeder) for Webarchive / National Library as a fullstack developer
- 14 months of full time Django development at [coex.cz](http://coex.cz)
- 6 months researching [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)
- 5 years working as a freelance developer doing a lot of smaller projects.
