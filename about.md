My personal / experimental blog. I won't be contributing here much. Its mostly just to play with Jekyll and frontend encryption. 

So far the encryption process is very manual and depends on [SJCL demo](https://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/) but if I will use it more often I will probably make some tool to do it for me.
