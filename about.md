I don't know why I have this blog. I just like the idea. For some of the posts I already forgot the password. I just like the idea of encrypting things. ok? 

Stuff that brings me the money: 
- 2 years of developing [Seeder](https://github.com/WebArchivCZ/Seeder) for Webarchive / National Library as a fullstack developer
- 14 months of full time Django development at [coex.cz](http://coex.cz)
- 6 months researching [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)
- 5 years working as a freelance developer doing a lot of smaller projects, some of which reached their life cycle

Freelanced projects:
- [klckrystof.cz](http://klckrystof.cz) - Public site for a language school
- [vycepnastojaka.cz](http://vycepnastojaka.cz) - Website for the most popular pub in Brno
- [filtracnitechnika.cz](http://filtracnitechnika.cz) - Django project for an air company
- Some failed startups and projects, a lot of learning, about 5k of git commits
