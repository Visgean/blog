Hi, **I am Martin** (I go by **Visgean on the internet**). I am a software developer. Since 2010 I have worked  in London, Prague and remotely for a company in San Francisco. 
**See my [CV](/cv.pdf) for details.** Most of the times I have worked as self-employed contractor. I am an **EU citizen**.

# Experience

Languages:
- Python (11 years), Django (9 years), Django REST, Numpy, SciPy, Pandas
- Haskell (beginner level)
- Kotlin
- Javascript

Tech:
- Databases: Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Linux: Ubuntu / Debian / Arch Linux nginx / sytstemd 
- I have been through some SQL and caching optimizations. 
- Bitcoin, Ethereum (but I am very sceptical of blockchains that consume too much electricity)


## Contact me

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:visgean@gmail.com) if you are looking for backend / python contractor or something similar. I live in Edinburgh, but  I am **willing to move** for a short-term contract. I have also worked remotely.
