Hi, **I am Martin** (I go by **Visgean on the internet**). I have been working as a software developer since 2010. I have worked  in London, Prague and remotely for a company in San Francisco. 
**See my [CV](/cv.pdf) for details.** Most of the times I have worked as self-employed contractor. I am an **EU citizen**.

My focus is on the **back-end** side (server applications), I have worked as a full-stack developer before but I prefer to cooperate with front-end developers as it is much more effective. 

Over the years I have worked with many different technologies, but I have mostly worked with **Python**, SQL and Linux servers. Apart from that I have worked with Java, Kotlin, Haskell and JavaScript, but with these languages I would not be confident enough to work on anything but a hobby project.  

## Contact me if:

- You are looking for **backend / API developer**
- for a short term contracts (3-6 months)
- the position is in **London / Edinburgh** 
- or other interesting city, I am **willing to move** for a short-term contract
- or it is remote

## How to contact me:

- Preferably by [email](mailto:visgean@gmail.com)
- and ideally mention some details about the offer
- because if you just email me to give you a call 
- I might not do that.
