Hi, **I am Martin** (I go by **Visgean on the internet**). I am a software developer. Since 2010 I have worked  in London, Prague and remotely for a company in San Francisco. 
**See my [CV](/cv.pdf) for details.** Most of the times I have worked as self-employed contractor. I am an **EU citizen**.

My focus is on the **back-end** side (server applications), I have worked as a full-stack developer before but I prefer to cooperate with front-end developers as it is much more effective. 

Over the years I have worked with many different technologies, but  mostly with mix of **Python**, SQL, Linux servers, ocasionally I have also worked with Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn and matplotlib. Apart from that I have worked with Java, Kotlin, Haskell and JavaScript.  

## Contact me

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:visgean@gmail.com) if you are looking for backend / python contractor or something similar. I live in Edinburgh, but  I am **willing to move** for a short-term contract. I have also worked remotely.
