Experimental encrypted blog, originally thought just as a demonstration 
of how to handle privacy in a culture of transparency. The blog content is
hosted on full transparent platform - github so there is no possibility for any 
hidden content. But with frontend encryption (256-bit AES) I can also enforce privacy
even though everything is shared and public.
