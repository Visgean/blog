Friends (I HAVE FRIENDS OK) asked me for things to do in Prague, so I created this list. Its mostly things that I have done in Prague, not aspiring to be a real guide or anything. 

## Logistics:
- If you want to **change euros to czk do it in Mcdonalds** - buy something small and pay with euros, they will give you back money using the official rate. You should not have a problem with paying with Euros in malls and larger chain shops, but in local places or small pubs they might try to give you a bad rate or tell you to fuck off.  
- For navigation you can use Google maps but they don't have all connections. Use [IDOS](http://jizdnirady.idnes.cz/vlakyautobusymhdvse/spojeni/) to get around city and country, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/id473503749), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.mafra.jizdnirady).
- Install maps.me for **offline maps** and download data for Czech Republic. [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id510623322?_1lr=1), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro).
- People walk on the right. On escalators you are expected to stand on the right and make space for people walking on the left. 
- Crossing street on red light might get you fined for about 10 EUR. 
- Being loud or aggressive is not ok even if you are wasted, so if you are used to UK drunk behaviour you should appreciate how chill people are here when they are drunk.  
- Buy the damm tickets for transportation. The fine is about 60 eur and a single ticket for 90 minutes costs about one Eur, so buy like 10 of them.

## Náměstí Bratří Synků sort of pub tour
I used to live here, these are pubs that are very close so you can do sort of pub tour, this place is 10m by tram from Vaclav Square
- [Bašta](https://goo.gl/maps/EYTMqiqf6hR2) - very tradional pub and restaurant, I can recommend Quarter roast duck stuffed with potato pancakes and sauerkraut. 
- [Zlý Časy](https://goo.gl/maps/ZRpa2yoDCtQ2) - another traditional pub which has the largest offer of beers, its just 200m from the Basta.
- [Pohoda](https://goo.gl/maps/VKZgEq5RXK62) - this one is aimed at locals, so if you want to get gist of what a night life for normal people looks in Prague then go here. They usually go until 3am and the booz is cheap so get wasted! The night trams are just next to it so you are good to go. 

## Restaurants
- [Hotel Imperial](http://www.hotel-imperial.cz/) super fancy and not that expansive restaurant, you should get a reservation. 
- [T-Anker restaurant](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Slune%C4%8Dn%C3%AD+terasa+T-Anker,+s.r.o./@50.0889757,14.4250489,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x470b94ea50cb6d03:0xdfd37f1c092d47c8!8m2!3d50.0889757!4d14.4272376) this was one of my favourite restaurants, it has a good view on Prague. Unless you are going on Friday or Saturday evening you should not need reservation.

## Getting drunk
- [Krymska](https://goo.gl/maps/h7xgq5nDA2P2) popular street with a lot of pubs and cafes. 
- [Naplavka](https://goo.gl/maps/P9QQeana1Bk) - area next to the river, lots of hipsters and tourists, pubs and concerts. It has a very good view on the castle especially during the night.
- [Letenske sady](https://goo.gl/maps/QJzht5Dbd392) this is a cool place to have a drink and watch the city at night.
- [Vzorkovna](https://goo.gl/maps/2ecTzotqWPQ2) - undeground pub, kind of cool, you have to buy credits at entrance, don't be scared. 

## Stuff to do in the morning
- [DOX](https://goo.gl/maps/ddhbV9yf6nK2) Modern art gallery
- [Paralelni Polis](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Paraleln%C3%AD+Polis/@50.1034007,14.4505513,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xcad994427e27c9c0!8m2!3d50.1034007!4d14.4505513) cool bitcoin coffee, very close to DOX.
- [La Bohème Café](https://goo.gl/maps/8fJeYMgcrNv) nice cafe place
- [Pod Stromem Čajovým](https://goo.gl/maps/HXsp6GbuDh12) - tearoom open from 14:00. They have Shisha and Masala. Its very close from Beheme cafe.
- [Central Public Library](https://goo.gl/maps/4eqi6WS42mp) - if you need study room with wifi you can go here, its open without registration.  

## Other places
- [Slovansky ostrov](https://goo.gl/maps/33nHLSpk8HL2) you can rent one of these **stupid boats** here - it costs about $10 and you can get drunk on the river. 
- [Vysehrad](https://goo.gl/maps/7VuGFijshZP2)  castle complex and there are some pubs with nice view on the top.
- [Palladium](https://goo.gl/maps/sE2M3rHH13J2) - this is a good shopping mall.
