Friends (I HAVE FRIENDS OK) asked me for things to do in Prague, so I created this list. 

- My first suggestion is that if you want to change euros to czk do it in Mcdonalds - like buy something small and pay with euros, they will give you back money using the official rate. 
- https://goo.gl/maps/QJzht5Dbd392 this is a cool place to have a drink and watch the city at night 
- https://goo.gl/maps/P9QQeana1Bk - Naplavka is an area next to the river, there are many street pubs and concerts happening there
- https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Paraleln%C3%AD+Polis/@50.1034007,14.4505513,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xcad994427e27c9c0!8m2!3d50.1034007!4d14.4505513 this is a cool bitcoin coffee 
- https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Slune%C4%8Dn%C3%AD+terasa+T-Anker,+s.r.o./@50.0889757,14.4250489,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x470b94ea50cb6d03:0xdfd37f1c092d47c8!8m2!3d50.0889757!4d14.4272376 this was one of my favourite restaurants, it has a good view on prague
- https://goo.gl/maps/ZRpa2yoDCtQ2 - a traditional czech pub which usually has the largest offer of beers
- https://goo.gl/maps/EYTMqiqf6hR2 - another traditional czech restaurant/pub, they are cheap but you can meet a lot of cool people there... And I lived in the area. Its also 200m from the previous one
http://www.hotel-imperial.cz/ this is a place claire went to, its a bit expansive for me. 
- https://goo.gl/maps/2ecTzotqWPQ2 - undeground pub, kind of cool, you have to buy credits at entrance. 
- https://goo.gl/maps/7VuGFijshZP2 Vysehrad - kind of like a castle complex or something, there are some pubs on the top, there is a nice view
- https://goo.gl/maps/sE2M3rHH13J2 - this is a good shopping mall
- https://goo.gl/maps/h7xgq5nDA2P2 street with a lot of pubs and hipster cafes 
- https://goo.gl/maps/33nHLSpk8HL2 you can rent one of these stupid boats here - it costs about $10 and you can get drunk there
