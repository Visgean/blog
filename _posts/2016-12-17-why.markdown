Because it's fun! But more importantly sometimes I want to share something with my friends and I don't want other people to read it. I believe that when I meet somebody new they should get to know me linearly and not be able to just scroll through the history of my thoughts. 

Encrypting a blog post ensures that only people who really now you get access to your posts. But more importantly it enables you to talk about stuff you would not want to write publicly.
